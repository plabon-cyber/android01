\nThe merchandiser acts as the one point person for all communications with the customer. Whether there is a delivery problem or quality problem or approvals or anything, the merchandiser has to communicate with the customer and make him understand the situation. To be able to do so it is important that the merchandiser understand the quality and production norms. The merchandiser is expected to understand –\n\n

✓ Garment quality (visual, measurement, construction)\n
✓ Testing quality (fabric, trims &amp; garment)\n
✓Packaging quality\n

    <string name="Quality_Management">
\nQuality management is a method for ensuring that all the activities necessary to design, develop and implement a product or service are effective and efficient with respect to the system and its performance. Quality management can be considered to have three main components –\n\n

✓Quality control\n
✓Quality assurance &amp;\n
✓Quality improvement\n
</string>
    <string name="Quality_Management_System_in_Garment_Industry">
\nA number of systems, measures &amp; techniques are used so that only quality goods are produced in the first place &amp; defects do not originate at all. If they occur at all, there must be corrective action so that they are eliminated in the preliminary stage &amp; would not reappear, QMS generally employs the following measures, techniques to ensure that only quality goods are produced.\n\n

✓Inspect all incoming, in-process &amp; final goods to ensure quality of goods.\n
✓Ensure that all patterns &amp; grading of patterns are okay.\n
✓Inspect marker &amp; check if it is okay &amp; within consumption.\n
✓Inspect   spreading, cutting &amp; numbering.\n
✓ Ensure if relaxation times was given to knit fabric.\n
✓ Install   in-line inspector in the sewing lines.\n
✓Install  Traffic Light Chart system or other system to monitor quality in production line.\n
✓Inspect 100% goods delivered from sewing lines.\n
✓ Inspect the table quality passed garments with Statistical Technique.\n
✓ Control reject goods so that they do not mix-up with quality passed goods.\n
✓ Control repairable goods, washable goods so that they can be double checked to ensure quality.\n
✓Inspect goods with right equipments &amp; in right conditions (equipments should not be faulty &amp; inspection should be conducted on well lit table). S Inspect ironing, folding.\n
✓ Make repeat inspection of garments prior to poly-bagging.\n
✓Inspect poly-bagging &amp; assortment.\n
✓ Final table inspection is conducted prior to shipment of goods.\n
✓ Impart training to QA personnel so that they can easily identify defects &amp; understand the causes of defects.\n
✓ Impart training to QA personnel on Statistical Methods.\n
✓Make continuous improvement plans &amp; implement them.\n
</string>

    <string name="Quality_for_Export_Garment">\nIn an apparel industry manufactured garments must possess specified quality characteristics. They are given below –\n\n

✓ Measurements specified by the buyer.\n
✓ Specified sewing &amp; stitching quality.\n
✓ Raw materials must possess specified quality.\n
✓ Garments must possess specified design characteristics.\n
✓ Assortment specified by the buyer.\n
✓ Finishing, packing, packaging must be specified by the customers.\n\n

So, quality of garments implies whether the specified garment has been produced with specified raw materials, with buyer specified stitching &amp; sewing quality, with specified sizes, shapes, design &amp; assortment. The Challenges of garments factory are the followings-\n\n

✓Delivering of quality products.\n
✓Competitive price.\n
✓Delivery on time.\n
✓Short lead time.\n
✓Compliance of national laws and code of conduct.\n\n
</string>
    <string name="Quality_Level_of_a_Garment">\nBased on the existence of major &amp; minor defects garments can be classified into three categories –\n\n

        <b>✓ First quality garment.</b>\n
        <b>✓ Second quality garment.</b>\n
        <b>✓ Third quality garment.</b>\n\n

        <b>1st Quality Garments</b> - Apparels which can satisfy the buyers &amp; retain its all quality characteristics &amp; which do not possess any major defect are called 1\" quality or A-grade garments. A-Grade garments look well. They do not posses any major defect during purchase &amp; quality dose not decline on wearing.\n

        <b>2nd Quality Garments</b> - These garments though possess some minor defects, retain functional quality &amp; as such sale ability to the buyers. They sometimes lose some general good appearance characteristics but do not lose acceptability to the buyers. Some defects not visible from outside may also belong to these garments. Some buyers allow up to 2 main defects in 2nd quality garments. 3 or more major defects turn them into rejects.\n

        <b>3rd Quality Garments</b> - Apparels possessing major &amp; critical defects making functional quality impaired is 3rd quality garments. These garments are not in demand &amp; as such have no sale ability. Any critical &amp; major defect in any important part of a garment turns it into a reject.\n\n



<b>Zone Classification of a Garment -</b>\n
        <b>ZONE-A:</b>\n The zone of a garment that is easily visible is called Zone-A. Any minor defect falling on zone-A becomes major defect.\n
        <b>ZONE-B:</b>\n This zone is less visible than zone-A. Back upper side shirt or shirt yoke is zone-B.\n
        <b>ZONE-C:</b>\n Zone-C is the least visible portion of a garment. Defect on this zone are not visible.\n

</string>

    <string name="Garments_Quality">\nThe merchandiser should be aware of the quality parameters as laid down by the like minimum construction standards, defect zones, customer classification, packaging limitations etc. Defect
        A merchandiser should know that the customer will accept a small fabric defect like a slab in <b>ZONE C</b> but will not accept the same defect is <b>ZONE A.</b>\n\n

✓ Also a hole in a garment, whichever ZONE it falls in is always not acceptable.\n
✓ The merchandiser should also be aware of the packaging limitations. Maximum and minimum carton size, dimension and weight acceptable by the buyer.\n
✓Merchandise may have to take commercial decision based on understanding of the buyer quality level and so should work closely with the factory quality team as well as the buyer technical team.\n
</string>
    <string name="Testing_Quality">\nThe merchandiser should be aware of the various testing parameters in case of fabric. Garment and trims. Hence the different parameters on which the fabric, garment or trim are tested, the acceptable level, the tolerance level allowed by buyer. Should be known to the merchandiser.\n\n

✓ FPT (fabric performance test)\n
✓GPT (garment performance test)\n
✓Only if the merchandiser is aware of these things can he take rational and quick decisions at the time of a failure or problem\n
</string>
    <string name="Packaging_Quality">\nMerchandisers should have the knowledge of all those parameters. helps to deal with various day-to-day situations.\n\n

<b>For example - </b>Buyer has specified the number of pieces per carton and the maximum weight and dimensions of the carton. Suppose Pieces per Carton - 60 (given on the PO) and maximum weight of carton 16 kgs (given in quality manual). If each garment weights 300 grams then, the total carton weight will become around 20 kgs (18 kgs of samples + 2 kg as the weight of carton itself)- Thus merchandiser will have to seek permission from buyer to ship the order with 20 kg weight of carton OR change the PO
to state 45 pieces/carton. Further to this, the merchandise should also follow up on the quality inspections being done by the quality auditor on his / her style. Thus merchandiser should insist regular
quality checks of the product at various stages - in sewing, finishing and packing. The merchandiser should also ask for all the quality audit reports and study the same. This is important so that in case same defect is observed again and again, he can bring the same to the notice of top management so that adequate attention is paid to it and the problem is resolved quickly.\n
</string>

    <string name="Quality_Policy">\n<b>Cutting Section</b> - System adopted in Cutting Section,\n\n
✓On rcpt of all fabric are being inspected and relaxed before spreading.\n
✓During spreading all reject areas are marked for easy identification and replacement after cutting.\n
✓All parts are checked after cutting and reject parts are replaced from the cutting from fabric of same roll.\n
✓AH important areas are given cut-mark for easy control and to maintain quality./To control twisting of fabric we are tumbling the fabric (especially for low GSM fabric).\n
✓For all stripe fabric we are giving smaller lay and is doing hand-scissoring for stripe matching.\n
✓ Cutting parts from Top. Centre and Bottom are checked with the pattern to avoid any gross deviation after cutting.\n\n

        <b>Finishing Section</b> - System adopted in the Finishing Floor.\n\n
✓After cleaning the thread all garments are being sent to iron-man directly.\n
✓ In the iron table we are drawing size wise graded patterns of the body and the garments are being ironed conforming to the respective sizes.\n
✓ After ironing all garments are checked by QC and only OK garments are sent for 100% measurement and reject garments are segregated and taken away from the finishing floor.\n
✓ After doing 100% measurement of all bodies only the OK garments are sent for folding and packing.\n
✓We have appointed one QC to do the hourly checking of all garments and prepare a report in this regard and put up to AGM of the floor for his review.\n
✓ At the end of the day another QC person is doing the day-final and making a report in this respect and keeping record. If the garments are found with problem in the day-final then all the garments are being opened and re-checked\n
✓After complete finishing of any order we are doing the Pre-Final from the point of view of Buyer and making a complete report in his regard maintaining record also. If the result will be found OK only then we will be offering Final Inspection.\n
✓ Once the garments pass the Pre-Final inspection then all the garments are kept under constant surveillance.\n
</string>

    <string name="Guidelines_to_InLine_Quality_Inspection">\n An in-line inspector is a person who conducts quality inspection while the work is in process or in progress. He is designated to identify defects at (needle point). In order to successfully conduct quality inspection of garments some guidelines must be pursued. First of all, the inspector must be a trained person &amp; must be equipped with the following tools &amp; environment.\n\n
✓ A medium size table (of greenish grey color) lit with tube lights having light quantity to the tune of 1000 lax.\n
✓ A measuring tape: another measuring tape fixed on the table: the tape should be metallic origin.
Good quality scissors\n
✓ Gummed paper arrow to display location of defects, etc.\n

        <b>For inspection purpose the inspector should pursue the following guidelines – </b>\n\n

✓ Inspector must have a worksheet along with size-spec &amp; special buyer instructions. if there is any.\n
✓ For each style there should be an approved sample in close proximity to the inspector.\n

        <b>First pre-production &amp; production samples must be closely monitored &amp; inspected to check the following –</b>\n\n

✓ Check size-spec rigorously.\n
✓ Check sewing &amp; non-sewing defects.\n
✓ Check if there is any oil mark or stain mark or shading.\n
✓ heck if there are defects due to machine, needle, thread or feed mechanism. etc.\n
✓ Check if right color &amp; type of thread, button, zipper, lining, shell. label, logo, etc have been used.\n
✓ Check if buyer\'s special instructions have been followed or not.\n
✓ Check locations of major defects &amp; identify why they originated.\n
✓ Ensure that machines, tables &amp; operator hands are clean.\n
✓ Ensure that right type of needle, feed-mechanisms, etc. are in use.\n
✓ Always follow worksheet, buyer\'s instructions size-spec &amp; assortment.\n

    <string name="Guidelines_to_Table_Quality_Inspection">\nThe inspector who is trained must be equipped with the following tools &amp; environment –\n\n

✓ A wide table (of greenish grey color) lit with day-light type of tube lights: light quantity should be enough to the tune of 1,000 lax.\n
✓A measuring type, another measuring type fixed on the table. Good quality scissors.\n
✓ Gummed paper arrow to display location of defects etc.\n
✓Inspector must have a worksheet/P.O. sheet along with size-spec.\n
✓ Inspector must have special buyer instructions, if there is any.\n
✓ For each style there should be an approved sample in close proximity to the inspector.\n
✓If your factory has a quality manual approved by buyer, check with major &amp; minor defects as per that manual.\n

ADDITIONAL DETAILS:\n

Let\'s say the amount of H2SO4 you have in the flask is 1.15 grams (You get that by weighing the empty flask,\n
        putting the acid in, and reweighing it. The difference is the amount of acid you added.)\n

Then you add the 50 mls water and titrate to a methyl orange endpoint. You see that you used 22.1\n
        mls of the NaOH solution. The NaOH solution was standardized at 1.052N. Here are the calculations:\n

22.1 mls X 1.052 X 0.04904 = 1.14 grams of H2SO4\n

Then divide that number by what you started with (1.15 grams):\n

    <string name="boricacid"><h4><b><u>Boric acid is determined by acid-base titration method i.e\n
        Direct titration method.</u></b></h4>\n\n
Boric acid is a weak acid and hence it cannot be determined quantitatively in aqueous solution \n
        with standard Sodium hydroxide solution using visual indicator. However it can be determined by\n
        titrating with standard sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of polyhydric alcohols such as\n
        glycerol or mannitol because Glyceryl boric acid which is formed on treatment of Boric acid with glycerol.\n
        This Glyceryl boric acid acts as a strong acid and can be titrated against a standard Sodium hydroxide\n
        solution using visual indicator (Phenopthlein).\n
4 H3BO3 + 2 NaOH = Na2B4O7 + 7 H2O\n\n
Boric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide to produce sodium borate and water.\n
 Boric acid actually ionizes by accepting a hydroxide ion (and thus an electron pair) from water,\n
        rather than by donating H+.This makes it a Lewis Acid\n
B(OH)3 (aq.) + H2O ---------> B(OH)4- (aq.) + H+ (aq.)\n
The tetrahydroxyborate ion, in turn, can yield something that should look familiar.\n
4B(OH)4- (aq.) + 2H+ (aq.) --------->B4O72−(aq.)+9H2O\n\n

Again, we are dealing with a Lewis Acid, not a classic "proton donor", \n
        so these equations don\'t give us the typical Arrhenius acid-base equilibrium expressions (yet).\n
        Notice here the tetraborate ion, B4O72− , which occurs also with the ionization of borax. \n
        In a borax-boric acid buffer solution (~ pH 9), tetraborate and monohydrogen tetraborate are\n
        actually the primary species, as long as the boron concentration is greater than about 0.025 M.\n
 Equations 3 and 4 show us that a connection exists in solution between tetraborate, tetrahydroxyborate,\n
        and boric acid.\n
 In theory, it takes four moles of boric acid to yield one mole of B4O72- in solution.\n
        If we quadruple the coefficients in Equation 1 to correspond with Equation 2, we get 4B(OH)3.\n
        Equation  shows what happens when we combine the two equations:\n
4B(OH)3 (aq.) ---------> B4O72−(aq.)+ 5H2O +2H+ (aq.)\n\n

Notice that the H+ is now on the right, which is consistent with the fact that boric acid yields\n
        an acidic solution. Because H2B4O7 is not a strong acid, though, it does not completely ionize.\n
First ionization (Equation ):\n
H2B4O7 (aq.) --------->HB4O7- (aq.) +H+ (aq.)\n
Second ionization (Equation ):\n
HB4O7- (aq.)--------->B4O72- (aq.)+ H+ (aq.)\n\n

The sodium dithionite content can most readily be determined iodometrically. \n
        It is dissolved in a neutral formaldehyde solution in a standard flask.\n
        The dithionite, which is sensitive to oxidation, \n

However, this method of analysis does not differentiate between dithionite and any \n

    <string name="waterheardness"><h4><b><u>HARDNESS OF WATER BY EDTA TITRATION</u></b></h4>\n\n
Introduction\n
The ions involved in water hardness, i.e. Ca2+(aq) and Mg2+(aq), can be determined by titration with a chelating agent,\n
        ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), \n
        usually in the form of disodium salt (H2Y2-). The titration reaction is:\n\n
Ca2+(aq) + H2Y2-(aq) ⎯⎯→ CaY2-(aq) + 2H+(aq)\n
      Eriochrome Black T is commonly used as indicator for the above titration. \n
        At pH10, Ca2+(aq) ion first complexes with the indicator as CaIn+(aq) which is wine red. \n
        As the stronger ligand EDTA is added, the CaIn+(aq) complex is replaced by the CaY2-(aq) complex \n
        which is blue. The end point of titration is indicated by a sharp colour change from wine red to blue.\n\n
Titration using Eriochrome Black T as indicator determines total hardness due\n
        to Ca2+(aq) and Mg2+(aq) ions. Hardness due to Ca2+(aq) ion is determined by a separate\n
        titration at a higher pH, by adding NaOH solution to precipitate Mg(OH)2(s),\n
        using hydroxynaphthol blue as indicator.\n
Materials and Apparatus\n
50% w/v NaOH solution (50 g in 100 cm3 solution)\n

2. Add 30 drops of 50% w/v NaOH solution, swirl the solution and wait for a
couple of minutes to completely precipitate the magnesium ions as Mg(OH)2(s).\n
3. Add a pinch of hydroxynaphthol blue (exact amount to be decided by the\n
intensity of the resulting coloured solution) and titrate with 0.01 M EDTA until it\n
changes to sky blue (save the solution for colour comparison).\n

Formaldehyde conten test by Chromotropic acid\n\n

Each cloth sample cut into 1 square cm piece and boil in 5 ml of distilled water in a test tube (1st test tube).\n
        A few crystals of chromotropic acid add to 2 ml of 72% concentrated sulfuric acid in another test tube (2nd test tube).\n
        The cooled supernatant of the 1st test tube add to the 2nd test tube and the mixture heat over a flame.\n
        A red purple to violet color indicated a positive test (i.e. the presence of formaldehyde in textiles), \n
        while its absence indicated that the cloth sample did not contain formaldehyde.\n
        The intensity of red purple to violet color graded as 1+, 2+, or 3+.\n
        Clothes which showed the presence of formaldehyde reassess after washing. \n
        The textile samples rinse with detergent and water for 5 minutes and then wash with soap.\n
        After drying reassess for formaldehyde. The intensity of red purple to violet color was note after each wash. \n
        A decrease in the intensity of red purple to violet color indicated a decrease in the formaldehyde content after washing.\n\n

Chromotropic acid\n
Chromotropic acid has the formula is (HO)2C10H4(SO3H)2\n
IUPAC Name: (1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulfonic acid)\n
It can be used for as a reagent in the quantitative determination of the systemic herbicide,\n
        2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid.\n
Chromotropic acid is also used for testing of presence of formaldehyde.\n
The usefulness of this reagent in quantitative determination is the formation of a red colouration (peaking at 580nm wavelength)\n
        when chromotropic acid in 75% sulfuric acid reacts with formaldehyde. The colouration is specific to this aldehyde and\n
        is not produced from other organic species such as ketones and carboxylic acids.\n

the fabric is collected in Batcher.
The batches are generally
enclosed by plastic films. This
prevents absorption of carbon
