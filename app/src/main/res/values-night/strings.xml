ADDITIONAL DETAILS:\n

Let\'s say the amount of H2SO4 you have in the flask is 1.15 grams (You get that by weighing the empty flask,\n
        putting the acid in, and reweighing it. The difference is the amount of acid you added.)\n

Then you add the 50 mls water and titrate to a methyl orange endpoint. You see that you used 22.1\n
        mls of the NaOH solution. The NaOH solution was standardized at 1.052N. Here are the calculations:\n

22.1 mls X 1.052 X 0.04904 = 1.14 grams of H2SO4\n

    <string name="boricacid"><h4><b><u>Boric acid is determined by acid-base titration method i.e\n
        Direct titration method.</u></b></h4>\n\n
Boric acid is a weak acid and hence it cannot be determined quantitatively in aqueous solution \n
        with standard Sodium hydroxide solution using visual indicator. However it can be determined by\n
        titrating with standard sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of polyhydric alcohols such as\n
        glycerol or mannitol because Glyceryl boric acid which is formed on treatment of Boric acid with glycerol.\n
        This Glyceryl boric acid acts as a strong acid and can be titrated against a standard Sodium hydroxide\n
        solution using visual indicator (Phenopthlein).\n
4 H3BO3 + 2 NaOH = Na2B4O7 + 7 H2O\n\n
Boric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide to produce sodium borate and water.\n
 Boric acid actually ionizes by accepting a hydroxide ion (and thus an electron pair) from water,\n
        rather than by donating H+.This makes it a Lewis Acid\n
B(OH)3 (aq.) + H2O ---------> B(OH)4- (aq.) + H+ (aq.)\n
The tetrahydroxyborate ion, in turn, can yield something that should look familiar.\n
4B(OH)4- (aq.) + 2H+ (aq.) --------->B4O72−(aq.)+9H2O\n\n

Again, we are dealing with a Lewis Acid, not a classic "proton donor", \n
        so these equations don\'t give us the typical Arrhenius acid-base equilibrium expressions (yet).\n
        Notice here the tetraborate ion, B4O72− , which occurs also with the ionization of borax. \n
        In a borax-boric acid buffer solution (~ pH 9), tetraborate and monohydrogen tetraborate are\n
        actually the primary species, as long as the boron concentration is greater than about 0.025 M.\n
 Equations 3 and 4 show us that a connection exists in solution between tetraborate, tetrahydroxyborate,\n
        and boric acid.\n
 In theory, it takes four moles of boric acid to yield one mole of B4O72- in solution.\n
        If we quadruple the coefficients in Equation 1 to correspond with Equation 2, we get 4B(OH)3.\n
        Equation  shows what happens when we combine the two equations:\n
4B(OH)3 (aq.) ---------> B4O72−(aq.)+ 5H2O +2H+ (aq.)\n\n

Notice that the H+ is now on the right, which is consistent with the fact that boric acid yields\n
        an acidic solution. Because H2B4O7 is not a strong acid, though, it does not completely ionize.\n
First ionization (Equation ):\n
H2B4O7 (aq.) --------->HB4O7- (aq.) +H+ (aq.)\n
Second ionization (Equation ):\n
HB4O7- (aq.)--------->B4O72- (aq.)+ H+ (aq.)\n\n

    <string name="waterheardness"><h4><b><u>HARDNESS OF WATER BY EDTA TITRATION</u></b></h4>\n\n
Introduction\n
The ions involved in water hardness, i.e. Ca2+(aq) and Mg2+(aq), can be determined by titration with a chelating agent,\n
        ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), \n
        usually in the form of disodium salt (H2Y2-). The titration reaction is:\n\n
Ca2+(aq) + H2Y2-(aq) ⎯⎯→ CaY2-(aq) + 2H+(aq)\n
      Eriochrome Black T is commonly used as indicator for the above titration. \n
        At pH10, Ca2+(aq) ion first complexes with the indicator as CaIn+(aq) which is wine red. \n
        As the stronger ligand EDTA is added, the CaIn+(aq) complex is replaced by the CaY2-(aq) complex \n
        which is blue. The end point of titration is indicated by a sharp colour change from wine red to blue.\n\n
Titration using Eriochrome Black T as indicator determines total hardness due\n
        to Ca2+(aq) and Mg2+(aq) ions. Hardness due to Ca2+(aq) ion is determined by a separate\n
        titration at a higher pH, by adding NaOH solution to precipitate Mg(OH)2(s),\n
        using hydroxynaphthol blue as indicator.\n

Formaldehyde conten test by Chromotropic acid\n\n

Each cloth sample cut into 1 square cm piece and boil in 5 ml of distilled water in a test tube (1st test tube).\n
        A few crystals of chromotropic acid add to 2 ml of 72%1$ concentrated sulfuric acid in another test tube (2nd test tube).\n
        The cooled supernatant of the 1st test tube add to the 2nd test tube and the mixture heat over a flame.\n
        A red purple to violet color indicated a positive test (i.e. the presence of formaldehyde in textiles), \n
        while its absence indicated that the cloth sample did not contain formaldehyde.\n
        The intensity of red purple to violet color graded as 1+, 2+, or 3+.\n
        Clothes which showed the presence of formaldehyde reassess after washing. \n
        The textile samples rinse with detergent and water for 5 minutes and then wash with soap.\n
        After drying reassess for formaldehyde. The intensity of red purple to violet color was note after each wash. \n
        A decrease in the intensity of red purple to violet color indicated a decrease in the formaldehyde content after washing.\n\n

Chromotropic acid\n
Chromotropic acid has the formula is (HO)2C10H4(SO3H)2\n
IUPAC Name: (1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-3,6-disulfonic acid)\n
It can be used for as a reagent in the quantitative determination of the systemic herbicide,\n
        2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid.\n
Chromotropic acid is also used for testing of presence of formaldehyde.\n
The usefulness of this reagent in quantitative determination is the formation of a red colouration (peaking at 580nm wavelength)\n
        when chromotropic acid in 75%2$ sulfuric acid reacts with formaldehyde. The colouration is specific to this aldehyde and\n
        is not produced from other organic species such as ketones and carboxylic acids.\n

    <string name="cpbIntro">Cold Pad Batch Dyeing is one of the
widely used semi-continuous dyeing
process. It is mainly used in the
dyeing of cellulosic fiber like cotton

development process for Knit dyeing

a cold method where the dyeing

    1. Firstly the RFD (Ready for Dyeing)
Fabric is introduced with Cooling
Drum, it is a cooling system here
the fabric is cooled down.\n\n
2. Then the RFD Fabric is introduced
with pre-mixed dye liquor at Dye
Bath. Here Dye Bath Termp arownd
20-25°C and so it is called Cold
Pad Batch (CPB) Dyeing. A cooling
system is used for cooling the Dye
liquid and bath also.\n\n
3. Then it is passed through Padder.
The padder effectively forces the
dyestuff into the fabric. In the
stage excess dye solution is also
removed.\n\n
4. After removal of excess dye stuff
the fabric is collected in Batcher.
The batches are generally
enclosed by plastic films. This
prevents absorption of carbon
dioxide and water evaporation.\n\n
5. After removing batcher from
dyeing machine, it is placed at
Rotation Point. It takes around 8-
14 hours (Time depends on
Shade). Finally as the reaction is
complete the fabrics are washed.\n\n
